# Improved-Heavy-Rush
My bot is an improved version of the Heavy Rush. First, it creates multiple workers instead of the single one. Then, instead of just attacking the closest enemy, the heavy units will attack the enemy workers to cut off resources. It essentially relies on the heavy units to brute force past enemies and go straight to the enemy's resources.

"I want to improve this heavy rush. Make it create multiple workers at once, and also make the heavy units prioritize the enemy's workers instead of the closest enemy."
I found it very helpful because it helped me break down exactly what I wanted to change how the heavy rush worked.
